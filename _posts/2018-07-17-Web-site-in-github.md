Hosting  a web site in github is fast and easy. 

First of all you need to create a github account.

After that, you need to find a jekyll theme that you fancy. For example:
- https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll. [Take a look at it!](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)
- https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek [Take a look at it!](https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek/)
- https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme [Take a look at it!](https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/)
- https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme [Take a look at it!](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)
- https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/ [Take a look at it!](https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/)

Then, if the teme that you liked is on a repository, you need to fork the repository of the theme. As described in the [beautiful-jekyll site:](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) "*Fork this repository by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account*". 

To continue, change the repository name of your forked version to <yourusername>.github.io. As described in the [beautiful-jekyll site:](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll): "*This will create a GitHub User page ready with the Beautiful Jekyll template that will be available at http://<yourusername>.github.io within a couple minutes. To do this, click on Settings at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename*".

Finally, all that you have to do is customize your new site, modifying your name and the name of your site in the \_config.yml. And ypu can edit the posts contained in the \_posts folder to create new ones.
