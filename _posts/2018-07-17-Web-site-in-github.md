Hosting  a web site in github is fast and easy. 

First of all you need to create a github account.

After that, you need to find a jekyll theme that you fancy. For example:
- https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll [sample](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)
- https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek [sample](https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek/)
- https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme [sample](https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/)
- https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme [sample](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)
- https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/  [sample] (https://le4ker.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/)

Then, if the teme that you liked is on a repository, you need to fork the repository of the theme. As described in the jekyll site: "*Fork this repository by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account*".
