I'm going to present a book in a few weeks. Something I've never done before, but which I've seen several times. I don't consider myself a mature author, but still it seems that that is not a requirement to present a book. I guess that trying to keep sincere to the best parts of the books is the best way to go, sharing what you like. 

I think that I've been focused in the things that I don't like for a long time. I usually write horror or terrible stories, but lately I've been wanting to switch, to write about amazing and wondeful things. I wrote a short story that I feel more proper of that tendency not so long ago. I may post it in English here in a few days. Meanwhile I'll continue to code and to think about what to say the day of the book presentation.
