Yesterday I was talking with two of my workmates, one of [them](https://erickeduardoah.github.io/) mentioned that when applying
**regression** methods is not a very good idea to include a lot of similar points as those can cause **leverage** of the regression.
This **leverage** was supposed to bias a line or model towards the tendency of the data where the distance is shorter, such as in the red line of the following image:

I was curious about methods to avoid leverage, but instead of finding about leverage in general I found about [leverage points](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65912/precise-meaning-of-and-comparison-between-influential-point-high-leverage-point).
